# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The SQL RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) module is a core feature of the ChatBI application that enhances SQL query generation through intelligent retrieval of similar historical queries. This system uses vector embeddings to store and retrieve successful SQL queries based on user feedback, improving accuracy, consistency, and response speed over time. The module integrates with both the chat interface (`start_chat_ui.py`) and traditional Gradio interface (`gradio_app.py`) to provide seamless user experience with continuous learning capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a ChatBI user, I want the system to automatically search for similar historical queries when I ask a question, so that I can get more accurate and consistent SQL results based on proven successful examples.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a natural language query THEN the system SHALL search the vector database for similar historical queries with similarity scores
2. WHEN similar queries are found with high confidence (≥0.8) THEN the system SHALL directly return the cached SQL without calling the LLM
3. WHEN similar queries are found with medium confidence (0.6-0.8) THEN the system SHALL use them as examples to enhance the LLM prompt
4. WHEN no similar queries are found (similarity <0.6) THEN the system SHALL proceed with standard SQL generation
5. WHEN the RAG system is disabled in configuration THEN the system SHALL fall back to standard SQL generation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a ChatBI user, I want to provide feedback on successful queries so that the system can learn and improve future SQL generation for similar questions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user receives a satisfactory SQL result THEN the system SHALL provide a feedback mechanism (👍 button)
2. WHEN a user clicks the feedback button THEN the system SHALL store the query-SQL pair in the vector database
3. WHEN storing feedback THEN the system SHALL include metadata such as timestamp, user description, and query context
4. WHEN feedback is successfully stored THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message to the user
5. WHEN the same or similar query is asked again THEN the system SHALL be able to retrieve and use the stored example

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a ChatBI administrator, I want to monitor and manage the knowledge base so that I can ensure the quality and performance of the RAG system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the knowledge base interface THEN the system SHALL display statistics including total entries, average ratings, and usage counts
2. WHEN requested THEN the system SHALL provide the ability to refresh knowledge base statistics
3. WHEN the knowledge base grows large THEN the system SHALL maintain acceptable query performance (<3 seconds response time)
4. WHEN managing the knowledge base THEN the system SHALL support configuration of similarity thresholds and other RAG parameters
5. WHEN troubleshooting THEN the system SHALL provide debugging capabilities and detailed logging

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a ChatBI user, I want the RAG system to work seamlessly across different interfaces so that I have a consistent experience whether using the chat or traditional interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the chat interface (`start_chat_ui.py`) THEN the RAG functionality SHALL be fully integrated and accessible
2. WHEN using the traditional interface (`gradio_app.py`) THEN the RAG functionality SHALL be fully integrated and accessible
3. WHEN switching between interfaces THEN the knowledge base SHALL be shared and consistent
4. WHEN providing feedback in either interface THEN the feedback SHALL be stored in the same knowledge base
5. WHEN viewing knowledge base statistics THEN the data SHALL be consistent across both interfaces

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the RAG system to be properly configured and maintainable so that it can be easily deployed and managed in different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the system THEN all RAG dependencies (ChromaDB, sentence-transformers) SHALL be properly installed and configured
2. WHEN configuring the system THEN environment variables SHALL control RAG behavior (enabled/disabled, thresholds, etc.)
3. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL initialize the vector database and embedding service correctly
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages and graceful fallbacks
5. WHEN maintaining the system THEN it SHALL support backup and restore of the knowledge base data

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a ChatBI user, I want the RAG system to provide optimal performance and accuracy so that my queries are answered quickly and correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using cached SQL (high similarity) THEN the response time SHALL be significantly faster than standard generation
2. WHEN the knowledge base contains relevant examples THEN the SQL generation accuracy SHALL improve by at least 15%
3. WHEN asking the same question multiple times THEN the system SHALL return consistent results
4. WHEN the knowledge base grows THEN the system SHALL maintain performance through efficient vector search
5. WHEN providing examples to the LLM THEN the system SHALL limit to a maximum of 3 most relevant examples to avoid prompt bloat
